This repository houses Salt states used in the openSUSE and SUSE infrastructures.

Most of the code is specific to SUSE based operating systems and gets tested on the latest openSUSE Leap or Tumbleweed.

These formulas can be installed using the `infrastructure-formulas` package which is currently available in the `isv:SUSEInfra:Tools` and `openSUSE:infrastructure` projects and provides subpackages for each formula. Of course, any other installation routine for Git based Salt states can be applied as well.

Files are licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 unless a designated COPYING, LICENCE or LICENSE file in the respective formulas' subdirectory declares a different license.
